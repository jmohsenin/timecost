# timecost
A Chrome extension for showing the real cost of meetings.


## TODO
1. Make timecost work for all-day events
2. Add option about whether to include maybe and awaiting guests in the event count
3. Add option about whether to filter attendees without email addresses or not (current behavior is to, to filter out conference rooms)
4. Show timecost when creating an event from main calendar view
5. Figure out if we need moment with locales or not (currently using version with locales)
